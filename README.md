# DesignPatterns.Decorator
This is a demonstration from my DesignPattern series.

This application sends fictive notifications, on different channels.
The channels are configured via Decorator Pattern.

This job could definitely be implemented with other patterns, but with Decorator, the client can simply choose and chain whatever channel combinations he wants, 
without altering any external code.
